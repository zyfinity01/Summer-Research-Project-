Creating an ssh tunnel via the ECS servers to forward remote applications to my local machine.


In the following we can see a tunnel configured using the "barrets.ecs.vuw.ac" server as a "middle man" to get access within the internal VUW network. 
Then the remote server at the ip address of the NAS is being forwarded to my local machine. 
This allows me to access the synology setup remotely therefore "bypassing" the firewall.
