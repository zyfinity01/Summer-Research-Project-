Connectivity restored but unable to renew the certificate.

Found this site useful "Lets debug" but it appears that there isn't an issue.

Having read the forum switching certbot to use dns-01 as a method sounds like it would avoid a lot of potential firewall issues.

Found this reference on handling errors and suggests changing to a new method.
